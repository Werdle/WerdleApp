## Overview
### Description

It is a game that generates a word where users will have to guess what the word is within 6 tries. After each attempt, a hint will be given based on the orientation and selection of letters they've used in the attempt. If they've guessed the word correctly within the given attempts, they will move up a rank. Users will have to create an account in order to save what their rank is.
